# Lists
# Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items.
# Lists are defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements in square brackets ([]).
# Lists are zero-indexed.

# Tuples
# Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data.
# Tuples are defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements in parentheses ().
# Tuples are zero-indexed.

# Tuples can be useful when we need to ensure that an element is in a certain position and
# will not change. Since lists are mutable, the order of the elements can be changed on us.
# Since the order of the elements in a tuple can't be changed, the position of the element
# in a tuple can have meaning. A good example of this is when a function returns multiple values.
# In this case, what gets returned is a tuple, with the return values as elements in the tuple.
# The order of the returned values is important, and a tuple ensures that the order isnâ€™t going
# to change. Storing the elements of a tuple in separate variables is called unpacking.
# This allows you to take multiple returned values from a function and store each value in
# its own variable.

## For annexing indexes to the list, the enumerate() function is used.
# The enumerate() function is more idiomatic and readable than the range(len()) pattern.


# List comprehensions
# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
# Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operation
# applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those
# elements that satisfy a certain condition.

# Normal way

# Using list comprehension
